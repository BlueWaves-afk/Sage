## What SAGE Does — In One Sentence

SAGE continuously ingests geopolitical and logistics signals from four always-on sensory sub-agents (AIS, news, sanctions, prices), synthesizes them into a bitemporal knowledge graph and a human-readable wiki store via a triage-gated Nova Pro pipeline, and autonomously triggers disruption modelling, procurement rerouting, and SPR drawdown recommendations — turning a reactive crisis response into a managed, anticipatory process with a 28× speedup from threshold crossing to ranked output.

## Why SAGE Stands Out

| Property | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Synthesis-first ingest** | Raw signals never enter the vector store directly. Nova Pro reconciles every new signal against the current wiki page before `add_episode()` is called — the vector store holds synthesised, contradiction-resolved episodes, not raw facts. |
| **Anticipatory sandbox** | When risk crosses `elevated`, the sandbox forks a speculative future, runs the full ARIO cascade and procurement solver speculatively, and pre-stages results. When the crossing is confirmed, output appears in 300ms rather than 8,500ms (28× speedup). |
| **Bitemporal graph** | Every edge carries `observed_at` (when the event happened in the world) and `ingested_at` (when SAGE recorded it). `invalid_at IS NULL` = current fact. Old values are invalidated, never deleted. |
| **Source-aware triage** | AIS and price signals always route to `"extract"` (numeric, never prose). Sanctions always route to `"synthesize"`. News routes on cosine similarity. The routing decision is deterministic code, not an LLM call. |
| **Canonical entity registry** | 31 entities (22 routing entities + 9 crude grades), 153 aliases, 11 H3 cells. Three lookup indices: alias → entity_id, H3 cell → entity_id, price instrument → [entity_id]. No duplicate graph nodes; alias resolution happens before any LLM is invoked. |
| **Obsidian-style second brain** | Every entity has a git-versioned Markdown wiki page with YAML frontmatter and `[[Canonical Name]]` wikilinks. Opens natively in Obsidian; also parsed by the geospatial renderer for ArcLayer edges. |
| **No-hallucination risk scores** | Risk scores are expressed as prose sentences only (`_RISK_SENTENCE_TEMPLATE`). The synthesis prompt explicitly bans `"Current risk score:"` labels — prevents Nova Lite from inventing schema-less edge types. |

```

The knowledge base is the single source of truth — System 1 is the sole writer of raw signals; Systems 2–5 are pure consumers via `knowledge/api/read.py`. No agent imports `graphiti_core`, `falkordb`, or any `knowledge/` internal directly.

## Data Model

### Three Stores

| Store | What | Where | Written by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Episodic** | Every synthesised episode node with body text + `reference_time`. Non-lossy provenance ledger. | FalkorDB (Graphiti-managed) | `add_episode()` only |
| **Semantic graph** | Typed entity nodes + typed edges + 1024-D embeddings + bitemporal validity windows (`valid_at` / `invalid_at`). | FalkorDB (Graphiti-managed) | `add_episode()` only |
| **/wiki store** | One Markdown file per entity. YAML frontmatter + `[[Canonical Name]]` wikilinks + `links_out` list. Git-versioned. | `knowledge/wiki/` | `write_wiki_page()` only, after `add_episode()` succeeds |

### Entity Types

| Type | Count | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `Corridor` | 4 | Strait of Hormuz, Bab-el-Mandeb, Suez Canal, Strait of Malacca |
| `Supplier` | 5 | Saudi Aramco, NIOC, ADNOC, Rosneft, Iraqi Oil Ministry |
| `Refinery` | 3 | Jamnagar Refinery, Mangaluru, Paradip |
| `Port` | 4 | Vadinar, Yanbu, Sikka, Fujairah |
| `SPRCavern` | 3 | Vizag SPR, Mangaluru SPR, Padur SPR |
| `Authority` | 3 | OFAC, EU, UN |
| `Vessel` | dynamic | registered at runtime via `register_vessel()` |
| `GeoEvent` | dynamic | `[[AIS Anomaly — Larak Cluster]]`, `[[2019 Tanker Attacks]]` |
| `PendingScenario` | dynamic | speculative futures from sandbox |
| `ScenarioOutput` | dynamic | ARIO results |
| `CrudeGrade` | static | Arab Light, Basra Heavy, etc. |

### Edge Types

| Edge | From → To | Key Attributes |
|---|---|---|
| `RISK_STATE` | Corridor / Supplier / Refinery → itself | `score`, `band`, `factor_ais`, `factor_gdelt`, `factor_price`, `factor_sanctions`, `rationale` |
| `EXPORTS_VIA` | Supplier → Corridor | `daily_export_mbpd`, `throughput_share_pct` |
| `FEEDS` | Corridor → Refinery / Port | `throughput_share_pct` |
| `SUPPLIES` | Supplier → Refinery | `grade`, `daily_export_mbpd` |
| `CONFIGURED_FOR` | Refinery → CrudeGrade | `compatibility_score`, `gravity_range_api` |
| `SANCTIONED_BY` | Vessel / Supplier → Authority | `effective_date`, `list_name` |
| `BYPASS_ROUTE` | Corridor → Corridor | `capacity_mbpd`, `lead_time_days` |
| `FEEDS_RESERVE` | Supplier / Port → SPRCavern | `fill_rate_mmt_day` |
| `AFFECTS_SCENARIO` | Corridor → ScenarioOutput | `gap_mbpd`, `confidence` |

## Contracts

All inter-agent contracts live in `contracts/` and import nothing from the rest of the codebase — they are pure Pydantic schema. This is the strict boundary that allows every system to be built in parallel without coupling.

**`NormalizedSignal`** (`contracts/signal.py`) is System 1's only output type. It carries the signal source, timestamps (both `observed_at` for when the event happened in the world and `ingested_at` for when the sub-agent emitted it), `entity_refs` (canonical display names from the registry), a one-line `summary` that becomes the triage embedding input, `force_synthesis` to bypass the similarity gate, and a `payload` dict for source-specific fields. Every sub-agent emits this type; the KB consumer accepts nothing else.

**`ScenarioOutputData`** (`contracts/outputs.py`) is System 2's output. It encodes the ARIO disruption model result: supply gap in mbpd, gap duration, day-by-day feedstock gap timeline, price impact bounds, SPR depletion projection, and a `status` field (`"speculative"` when produced by the sandbox, `"confirmed"` when produced from a live crossing). Systems 3 and 4 read this to scope their work.

**`ProcurementRecData`** (`contracts/outputs.py`) is System 3's output. It contains a TOPSIS-ranked list of alternative procurement options, each with supplier, grade, corridor, landed cost, lead time, grade compatibility score, and rationale. System 5 renders this directly in the copilot recommendations panel.

**`SPRScheduleData`** (`contracts/outputs.py`) is System 4's output. It encodes a day-by-day draw/hold/refill plan for India's three SPR caverns, the probability the buffer constraint is satisfied, and a policy memo for the System 5 copilot to cite.

**`contracts/bands.py`** defines the five risk bands (`calm · watch · elevated · action · critical`) and their score thresholds. The orchestration monitor, the triage gate, and the UI colour mapping all import from this single source — changing a threshold here propagates everywhere automatically.

The contracts are the freeze boundary. If any field name changes after System 1 and System 2 are both in development, serialization breaks silently at runtime. Treat `contracts/` as append-only once two or more systems depend on it.

---

## System 1 — Sensory Agent Wiring Guide

System 1 is the **sole producer** of raw signals. Sub-agents push `NormalizedSignal` onto the Redis queue via `push_signal()` — they never call `ingest_signal()` or `write_risk_state()` directly.

### Entity Resolution

Before emitting any signal, populate `entity_refs` with canonical display names from the entity registry. Wrong names create duplicate graph nodes.

```python
from knowledge.registry import resolve_h3, resolve_instrument, resolve_name, canonical_name

# AIS: H3 cell → entity
entity_id = resolve_h3("8a2a1072b59ffff")       # → "corridor_hormuz"
display    = canonical_name(entity_id)            # → "Strait of Hormuz"

# Price: ticker → entities
entity_ids = resolve_instrument("BZ=F")           # → ["corridor_hormuz", "corridor_bab_el_mandeb"]
displays   = [canonical_name(eid) for eid in entity_ids]

# Sanctions / News: free-form name → entity
entity_id = resolve_name("Hormuz Strait")         # → "corridor_hormuz"  (alias lookup)
display    = canonical_name(entity_id)            # → "Strait of Hormuz"
```

**Canonical names — the 22 routing entities** (sub-agents resolve these via H3/instrument/name; 9 crude grades also registered):

| Category | Canonical names |
|---|---|
| Corridors | `"Strait of Hormuz"`, `"Bab-el-Mandeb"`, `"Suez Canal"`, `"Strait of Malacca"` |
| Suppliers | `"Saudi Aramco"`, `"NIOC"`, `"ADNOC"`, `"Rosneft"`, `"Iraqi Oil Ministry"` |
| Refineries | `"Jamnagar Refinery"`, `"Mangaluru"`, `"Paradip"` |
| Ports | `"Vadinar"`, `"Yanbu"`, `"Sikka"`, `"Fujairah"` |
| SPR sites | `"Vizag SPR"`, `"Mangaluru SPR"`, `"Padur SPR"` |
| Authorities | `"OFAC"`, `"EU"`, `"UN"` |

### Sub-Agent Rules

| Sub-agent | Push trigger | `force_synthesis` | Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AIS** | Anomaly cluster detected (gap > 4h or dark vessels); NEVER per position ping | Always `False` | 0–10/hr normal, up to 50/hr during crisis |
| **News** | Per article, after Nova Micro finds ≥1 resolved entity; discard unresolved | Always `False` | 0–20 per 15-min cycle |
| **Sanctions** | Immediately on any diff (add or remove); both adds and removals matter | Always `True` | 0–5 per 6h cycle; up to 20+ during burst |
| **Price** | BOCD changepoint or sustained regime shift only; normal ticks never pushed | Always `False` | 0–3/day calm; up to 15/day crisis |

**New vessels (sanctions sub-agent):** call `register_vessel(mmsi, name)` before `push_signal()` so the new entity resolves correctly in the next news article.

### `_FeatureVector` — Fusion Model Interface

```python
@dataclass
class _FeatureVector:
    ais_gap_count_24h:          float   # AIS gaps > 4h in last 24h
    ais_dark_vessel_count:      float
    ais_anomaly_score_max:      float   # max HABIT score (0..1)
    ais_gap_duration_max_h:     float
    ais_monitored_cell_pct:     float   # % of tracked H3 cells with activity
    ais_velocity_std:           float
    gdelt_tone_24h_mean:        float   # negative = hostile
    gdelt_tone_delta:           float
    news_severity_max:          float   # 0..1
    news_event_count_24h:       float   # count of severity > 0.7 events
    price_brent_pct_change_24h: float
    price_bocd_flag:            float   # 1.0 if BOCD breakpoint detected
    price_regime:               float   # 1.0 if regime = stressed
    price_war_risk_premium:     float   # 0..1
    sanctions_new_additions_24h: float
    sanctions_vessel_count:     float
    sanctions_major_entity:     float   # 1.0 if major state entity sanctioned
```

### Build Checklist

- [ ] Sub-agent calls only `push_signal()` — never `ingest_signal()` or `write_risk_state()`
- [ ] AIS: `resolve_h3()` → `canonical_name()` for `entity_refs`; push per anomaly cluster, never per ping
- [ ] Price: `resolve_instrument()` → `canonical_name()`; push only on BOCD changepoint or regime shift
- [ ] Sanctions: `resolve_name()` → `register_vessel()` for new MMSI before push; `force_synthesis=True` always
- [ ] News: Nova Micro extraction → `resolve_name()` for each candidate → discard unresolved
- [ ] `observed_at` = when the event happened in the world, not when your sub-agent detected it
- [ ] `signal_id` = ULID or UUID, unique per emission
- [ ] `raw_ref` = S3 key or DB ID of verbatim raw record
- [ ] Container calls `await kb_init()` before the first `push_signal()`

## Instantiating Foundational Knowledge (Context Bundle)

Before any live signal arrives, SAGE is **instantiated** with a foundational knowledge snapshot — the
geopolitical entities and the relationships between them. This is to SAGE what pretrained weights are
to a model: a **load**, not a train (`from_pretrained`, not `fit`). Live signals (System 1) then layer
continual updates on top.

The knowledge lives in a versioned, provenance-tracked **context bundle** with **three layers**
(61 entities: corridors, suppliers, refineries, crude grades, ports, SPR caverns, authorities, and
historical geopolitical events):

```
data/india-energy-2026.context/        # the bundle ("knowledge2026")
├── manifest.yaml                       # metadata, source registry, estimation methods
├── facts/                              # LAYER 1 — structured ground truth (CSVs)
│   ├── nodes/*.csv                     #   incl. authorities.csv, geo_events.csv (history)
│   └── edges/*.csv                     #   EXPORTS_VIA, FEEDS, SUPPLIES, CONFIGURED_FOR, BYPASS_ROUTE
├── sources_index.csv                   # entity_id → authoritative URLs
├── sources/<entity_id>.md              # LAYER 2 — real fetched evidence (grounding text)
└── narratives/<entity_id>.md           # LAYER 3 — per-entity prose with [[wikilinks]] (optional)
```

**Three kinds of knowledge, loaded differently:**

| Layer | Example | How it loads |
|---|---|---|
| **Facts** (CSV) | `Jamnagar capacity = 1.40 mbpd`, `Arab Light API = 32.8` | Written **directly** as graph attributes. Deterministic — no LLM "reconciles" a known number. |
| **Sources** (fetched text) | the Wikipedia/EIA article behind an entity | The **grounding evidence** the LLM summarises (RAG) — prevents hallucination. |
| **Narratives** (Markdown) | "Why Hormuz is critical; its tie to `[[Saudi Aramco]]`" | Routed through the **synthesis path** — the same one System 1 uses for live signals. |

Every facts row carries a `tier` (`real` / `derived` / `estimated`) and a `source` — the loader
**rejects any unsourced row**, the machine-checked "no simulated data" guarantee.

**How instantiation populates all three stores.** `bundle.instantiate(g)` runs three phases:

```
Phase 1 — FACTS       facts/*.csv ──► structural episodes ──► add_episode()
                                                              → Store 1 (episodic) + Store 2 (graph attrs)

Phase 2 — NARRATIVES  body = hand-authored | source-grounded (Nova Pro over sources/) | facts-only | stub
                      render_wiki_page() ──► write_wiki_page()  → Store 3 (wiki)
                                        └─► add_episode(body)   → Stores 1 + 2 (relations + vectors)

Phase 3 — CANONICALIZE  dedup RELATES_TO edges + merge alias-variant nodes (vs the registry)
```

Phase 2 narratives go through the **same synthesis machinery System 1 uses** (reconciled prose,
`[[wikilinks]]`, `links_out` relations). The authoring precedence is **hand-authored → source-grounded
→ facts-only → stub**, so the wiki store is always fully covered and entities with fetched evidence are
grounded in real text. Phase 3 removes the duplicate edges / alias-variant nodes that LLM extraction
otherwise leaves behind.

> **Authoring vs distribution.** The `.context` bundle is the human-authored *source* (facts + prose) —
> diffable, swappable, easy to contribute to. Instantiation reconciles it through the pipeline. (A
> future `export_baked()` can snapshot the reconciled state for deterministic fast loading — the true
> "frozen weights" — but the source bundle stays the canonical, editable artifact.)

### Instantiate (the two-command workflow)

```bash
# 1. Infrastructure up (FalkorDB stores the graph+vectors under knowledge/graph_store)
docker compose up falkordb redis -d

# 2. Fetch the bundle's source evidence → sources/<entity_id>.md  (real text for RAG grounding)
python scripts/fetch_sources.py data/india-energy-2026.context

# 3. Instantiate: facts → graph attributes; narratives → synthesis → wiki + graph + vectors.
#    Run against LIVE Bedrock — the stub LLM neither extracts typed fields nor synthesises prose.
FALKORDB_HOST=localhost LLM_PROVIDER=bedrock \
  python scripts/sage_instantiate.py data/india-energy-2026.context
```

The CLI shows a live loader (phase · entity · progress bar) and a read-back of the wiki page count
and graph risk states. Flags: `--no-llm-author` (deterministic stubs instead of LLM narratives),
`--facts-only` (skip narratives/wiki).

**Grounding (anti-hallucination):** for an entity with cached source text in `sources/`, the LLM
writes the narrative **only from that text + the structured facts** — it does not draw on parametric
memory. Precedence per entity: hand-authored `narratives/*.md` → source-grounded → facts-only → stub.

**Library API** (what the CLI calls under the hood):
```python
from knowledge.context import load_bundle
bundle = load_bundle("data/india-energy-2026.context")   # parses + validates provenance
counts = await bundle.instantiate(g, author_missing_with_llm=True)   # {facts, narratives}
```

**Swap the worldview** by pointing at a different bundle — by year (`india-energy-2027.context`),
region (`europe-gas-2026.context`), or domain. Build your own with the format spec:
[`data/CONTEXT_BUNDLE_SCHEMA.md`](data/CONTEXT_BUNDLE_SCHEMA.md). Full sourcing rationale per value:
[`docs/data.md`](docs/data.md).

> **Refresh cadence:** most of a bundle changes once a year (refinery capacity, assays, import shares)
> or never (coordinates, distances). Pull once, commit, version as a new dated bundle — don't build

## Upgrading the Knowledge Base to a New Bundle

When a new `.context` bundle is available (e.g. `india-energy-2027.context` with updated refinery capacities, new suppliers, revised TOPSIS weights), you can apply it **without losing any dynamic KB data** — RISK_STATE edges, GeoEvent nodes, live episodes from System 1, and wiki pages written by the synthesis path are all preserved.

### What the upgrade replaces vs. preserves

| Layer | Action |
|---|---|
| **Structural facts** — node attributes (capacity, assay, throughput), edge weights (volume, share, compatibility), model params (ARIO, routing, TOPSIS, SPR/SDP, grade, heuristic, economics) | **REPLACED** — upserted from the new bundle's CSVs |
| **RISK_STATE edges** — live risk scores, factor breakdowns, rationale strings | **PRESERVED** — written by System 1, never touched by the upgrade |
| **GeoEvent nodes, Vessel nodes** — dynamic entities registered at runtime | **PRESERVED** |
| **Graphiti episodes** — every event the system has ever processed | **PRESERVED** |
| **Wiki narratives from System 1** — synthesised pages for live signals | **PRESERVED** |
| **Wiki pages for changed entities** | **RE-SYNTHESIZED** — a `## Context Update` note is appended with the new structural facts; the rest of the page is unchanged |

An audit episode (`bundle-upgrade-{old_version}-to-{new_version}`) is written to the KB after every successful upgrade so the transition is part of the provenance ledger.

### Run an upgrade

```bash
# Point SAGE_BUNDLE_PATH at the current bundle so the upgrade can diff
export SAGE_BUNDLE_PATH=data/india-energy-2026.context

# Apply the new bundle
python3.11 -m knowledge.context.upgrade data/india-energy-2027.context
```

Output:

```
Upgrade complete:
  old_version: 1.1.0
  new_version: 1.2.0
  node_attrs_updated: 142
  edge_attrs_updated: 37
  edges_reconciled: 41
  exposures_derived: 22
  wiki_resynced: 8
```

After the upgrade, set `SAGE_BUNDLE_PATH` to the new bundle path so agents read the updated params on the next restart.

### All model parameters are bundle-driven

No numeric constant is hardcoded in agent code. Every parameter that affects model behaviour lives in one of the bundle's param CSVs:

| CSV | Controls |
|---|---|
| `params/ario_params.csv` | System 2 — ARIO cascade: supply shares, bypass capacity, price elasticity, GDP/inflation multipliers |
| `params/sectors.csv` | System 2 — Leontief IO sectoral weights |
| `params/routing_params.csv` | System 3 — VLCC costs and lead times per country, war-risk premium |
| `params/ranking_params.csv` | System 3 — TOPSIS criterion weights (cost, lead time, compatibility, corridor risk) |
| `params/grade_params.csv` | System 3 — Grade compatibility tolerances (API/sulfur sigma, floors, weights) |
| `params/spr_params.csv` | System 4 — SDP discount rate, max draw fraction, buffer threshold, crisis-resolution probabilities |
| `params/economics_params.csv` | Shared — baseline Brent price, daily consumption, risk filter thresholds, real-options window |
| `params/heuristic_params.csv` | Orchestration — scenario heuristic bounds, disruption day defaults, SPR policy thresholds |

To change any value: edit the CSV in the bundle, bump `bundle_version` in `manifest.yaml`, run `python3.11 -m knowledge.context.upgrade <new_bundle_path>`.

### Building a bundle for a new region or year

See [`data/CONTEXT_BUNDLE_SCHEMA.md`](data/CONTEXT_BUNDLE_SCHEMA.md) for the full format specification. Every row must carry a `tier` (`real` / `derived` / `estimated`) and a `source` that resolves to a registered entry in `manifest.yaml` — the loader rejects any unsourced row as a hard validation error.

### Data provenance — what's real vs estimated

Every value in the shipped `india-energy-2026` bundle is catalogued in [`data/india-energy-2026.context/DATA_PROVENANCE.md`](data/india-energy-2026.context/DATA_PROVENANCE.md): its tier, its source (with links), and — for the values reviewed against live data in July 2026 — the correction applied and the citation. Real values trace to EIA, PPAC, ISPRL, Aramco/BP assays, MOSPI, and OFAC; derived values state their method; estimated values fall into three honest buckets (analyst-assigned structural weights, live-at-runtime placeholders, and tunable policy/behavioural parameters). Judges and users can audit the whole data footprint there.
